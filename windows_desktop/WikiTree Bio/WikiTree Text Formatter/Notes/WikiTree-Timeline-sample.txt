Thomas Reuben Whitfield Burn is a name genealogists dream of, it is so unusual it must be easy to research, until you find there are two people with the name, then you find one is the father of the other!
	 
This is the father, he was born June 1, 1859 at 44 Tyneside Terrace, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, England. Thomas was raised by his grandparents, which should mean that he shows in up the 1861 census age 2 or 3 years but he does not. He does show up 10 years later living with his grandparents, James Burn and Dorothy in Newcastle on Tyne. He is a Burn, his grandfather is a Burn so we need to find the man in the middle.
	 
Back to earlier census pages to check the whole family. In 1841 James and Dorothy are 20, recently married and living with Dorothy's family. In 1861 they have a 20 year old Daughter, Ann and an 11 year old son James. With the best will in the world I cannot imagine James is the father which leaves us with Ann as the unmarried mother. The 1851 census show two young sisters who apparently died young. There is no mention of Thomas anywhere in the 1861 census, either the family hid him from the census out of shame or he was raised by another family and was known by a different name.
	 
Thomas returned and lived with his grandparents until sometime in the 1880's, Ann married early in 1871 to Thomas Whitfield, research shows his middle name was Reuben, so when TRW Burn was about 21 his parents married. When Thomas married Mary Annie Newton, on 16 December 1896 he left the name of his father off the marriage certificate.
	 
=== Timeline ===
	 
: '''1859''' Thomas Reuben Whitfield was born 1 June 1859 at 44 Tyneside Terrace, Elswick, Newcastle Upon Tyne (at the home of his grandparents). The birth was registered on July 11, 1859 by his mother [[Burn-136|Ann Burn]] (Birth Certificate Registration No. 237, Registration District of Newcastle Upon Tyne, Sub-district Westgate, County of Northumberland and Borough of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.)
	
:'''1861''' The 1861 census indicates that James and Dorothy Burn were living at 44 Tyneside Terrace, Elswick, Newcastle. Living with them at the time was their daughter Ann, aged 20, their son James, aged 11, and a son, Thomas, aged 10. Since James and Dorothy did not have a son named Thomas, one suspects that this was his grandson, Thomas Reuben, aged 1 (there may have been an error made in the transcription).
