# gedfmt

This tool helps to format WikiTree profiles that are imported through `.gedcom` files.

As of November 2021, it requires being run locally in order to access it. This is unfortunately
a bit technical. It requires opening a command prompt / terminal, running the server executable,
and then opening the URL (http://localhost:29254/).

I plan to eventually host it at http://gedfmt.com but have not gotten to it yet. If that is too
complicated, try out an alternative like https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:WikiTree_AGC or
the desktop application at https://github.com/Omustardo/gedfmt/releases/tag/desktop.

## Written Instructions

1. Create the profile without manual edits to the main text box.
2. Edit the newly created profile, and copy the entire text box into the left side of gedfmt.com
3. Click the "format" button in the top left of gedfmt.com.
4. Click the "copy to clipboard" button in the top right corner.
5. Then paste the content back into the WikiTree profile.
6. Make sure the output looks reasonable. Keep an eye out for references at the very bottom of the input being removed. I'm not entirely sure when this happens, but I've seen it sometimes.
